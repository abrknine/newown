1) add proper validation in wallet services and DTO 
2) installed a validation library on top of validation on model for extra validation
3) removed async await from debit(service and controller) as there is no real db involves as of now 
4) made db private in services of wallet as no real db invoves in real db we can use DI pattern to inject db instance in constructor to use that
5) make return type same in debit as mentioned in README
