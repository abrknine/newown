1) added addSubscription and cancelSubscription async thunks in subscriptionsSlice.ts to call POST and PATCH api
2) added addCase handlers for both thunks in extraReducers to update redux state and activeCount after api response
3) added "Add Subscription" button and per-item "Cancel" button in SubscriptionsTable.tsx

Design Issue:
PATCH /api/subscriptions does not accept a subscription id it always cancels the first active subscription not the one user clicked so clicking cancel on any subscription cancels the wrong one

Possible fixes:
1) best fix: update api to accept { id } in request body and cancel that specific subscription
2) quick fix: re-fetch all subscriptions from server after every cancel to keep ui in sync
3) ui fix: show single "Cancel Next Subscription" button instead of per-item buttons so ui honestly reflects what api does
